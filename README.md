# Optional-Project

Once you run the code you will see user input asking for the amount of classes student one is taking. You can enter in any number you like and you can type
each class (CS490, CS303, PHY201, etc) as you see fit and provide a high, medium, and low priority (High = 0, Medium = 1, Low = 2). The loop with only run two
times as we only provided 2 as the number of students to enter for array of student objects.
